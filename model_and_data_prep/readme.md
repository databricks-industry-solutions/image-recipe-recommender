The notebooks in this folder are intended to be run in a Databricks environment.  They provide the logic for the preparation of the data that forms the searchable index employed by the search model as well as the logic associated with the deployment of the model to the REST API used by the application's backend.

To import the notebooks into your Databricks workspace, please follow the steps provided [here](https://docs.databricks.com/notebooks/notebooks-manage.html#import-a-notebook).
