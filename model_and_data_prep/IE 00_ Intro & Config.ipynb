The challenge is that the Data Scientists and Data Engineers who often develop the ML/AI backends work with very different technologies and have very different development processes from those employed by Application Developers, making integration difficult.\n\nWith the application developed here, our goal is to illustrate how developers from very different disciplines can collaborate to bring forward some exciting functionality for their shared users. Using a publicly available dataset and pre-trained models, we deploy our data and model assets behind an easy to consumer REST API.  This work unfolds across two resources, each of which needs to be executed in sequence in order to recreate the REST API serving the application.  These resources are:\n</p>\n\n* IE 01: Data Preparation (Notebook)\n* IE 02: Model Deployment (Notebook)"],"metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+cell":{"title":"","showTitle":false,"inputWidgets":{},"nuid":"277a3bbc-ed12-4026-90f7-228ed3055c4f"}}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Configuration\n\nThe remainder of this notebook houses the configuration information consumed across the *IE 01* and *IE 02* notebooks."],"metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+cell":{"title":"","showTitle":false,"inputWidgets":{},"nuid":"ca87b16f-81b3-4dcd-aca6-6a2e3613ec89"}}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["if 'config' not in locals():\n  config = {}"],"metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+cell":{"title":"Initialize Configuration Variable","showTitle":true,"inputWidgets":{},"nuid":"63d0b9ff-46dc-4bee-b680-a7a49e54671e"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":0},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# set database name\nconfig['database name'] = 'embeddings'\n\n# create database to house mappings\n_ = spark.sql('CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS {0}'.format(config['database name']))\n\n# set database as default for queries\n_ = spark.catalog.setCurrentDatabase(config['database name'])"],"metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+cell":{"title":"Initialize Database","showTitle":true,"inputWidgets":{},"nuid":"195ec278-c58f-4409-8b2f-7e7cc179ca01"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":0},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# mount path where files are stored\nconfig['mount path'] = '/mnt/image_embeddings'"],"metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+cell":{"title":"Storage Settings","showTitle":true,"inputWidgets":{},"nuid":"deb2baf7-e43d-42b6-80a3-666119dbd62a"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":0},{"cell_type":"code","source":["config['model name'] = 'recipe_model'"],"metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+cell":{"title":"Model Settings","showTitle":true,"inputWidgets":{},"nuid":"1f60722f-de71-47a7-9396-7230e2a0ca75"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":0},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["&copy; 2022 Databricks, Inc.
